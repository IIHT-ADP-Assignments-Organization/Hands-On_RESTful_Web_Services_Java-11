//Re-create our Todo API routes using this naïve router concept

//Create the API and tests for the RouteDefinition class and implement the RouteDefinition class

//Create the Actual Router and use the map to implement the RouteServlet and test with some basic route 

//Create the missing routes in our final Router structure and test everything and see its working as before, but without the web.xml file, as desired and create API and tests for the RouteDefinition class and implement the RouteDefinition class
